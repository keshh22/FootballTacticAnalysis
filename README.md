# Football Tactical Analysis

This is a web application that converts camera footage clips from football games into a tactical map/field representation based on game state using yolo object detection. The python file can: 
1. Detect players from different teams based on kit colors and pre-defined parameters
2. Detect referees and current position of the ball
3. Track ball movements

The goal of this project is to computerize tactical analysis from different teams and make it a more time-saving an effective method to automate ball tracking for better understanding of how different teams play.
